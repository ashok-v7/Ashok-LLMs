Gemini 2.5 Pro Experimental is our most advanced model for complex tasks. It tops the LMArena leaderboard — which measures human preferences — by a significant margin, indicating a highly capable model equipped with high-quality style. 2.5 Pro also shows strong reasoning and code capabilities, leading on common coding, math and science benchmarks.

Gemini 2.5 Pro is available now in Google AI Studio and in the Gemini app for Gemini Advanced users, and will be coming to Vertex AI soon. We’ll also introduce pricing in the coming weeks, enabling people to use 2.5 Pro with higher rate limits for scaled production use.
